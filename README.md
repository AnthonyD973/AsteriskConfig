# AsteriskConfig

## Description and features of this project

I wanted to learn Asterisk, to be able to "take my homeline with me anywhere" (including on my cell phone or when away), and have a project that I could configure to my taste. This project solves exactly that.

**Key features:**

- Readymade asterisk config ; only forward the NAT ports, create the config file (explained below) and run one command (also explained below).
- Currently (at the time of writing this) working asterisk features: voicemail, voicemail MWI (blinking light on phone/softphone when there is an unread voicemail message), music on hold, SMS (via _SIP MESSAGE_ though, not _SIP SIMPLE_ ; my VoIP provider doesn't use _SIP SIMPLE_!), go straight to voicemail past a certain time, ...
- Some comments explain why things are done the way they are. This way you can use this project to learn the basics of VoIP with Asterisk like I did.
- (Experimental) An Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) client. While some endpoints (e.g. a cell phone) is not registered, this client buffers the SMS messages. It sends the missed messages to them once the enpoints register to Asterisk. This client is a systemd unit for robustness.
- MIT license: use/modify this project as you like as long as you keep the copyright. Please let me know (a.dentinger@gmail.com) if you use it though ; it will look good on my résumé! :)

**Limitations:**

- This project is not intended to have more than one user ; it is only intended to have multiple phones/softphones belonging to one user.
- I essentially "made my configuration public", so I did not build a way to disable some features. For example, there is no direct way not to use VoipMS without modifying this project's files. It's not difficult to do when you know where to do it (e.g., just delete some stuff in `pjsip.conf` to disable VoipMS stuff), but it's not direct.
- I have a few minor bugs with the AMI client. See [my issues tagged "AMI Client"](https://github.com/AnthonyD973/AsteriskConfig/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22AMI+Client%22++user%3AAnthonyD973).
- If you want to actually place or receive calls from "real" phones, you will need a VoIP provider. I transferred my regular home phone number to [VoipMS](https://voip.ms/), so this project is configured for VoipMS. However, as I learned while working on this project, each VoIP provider works differently because the SIP protocol allows for multiple ways to connect to a VoIP server. So you will probably have to look at your provider's website about how to configure `pjsip.conf` (*"chan_pjsip"*) to work with your provider and modify this project's `pjsip.conf` file. Additionally, some providers only show how to configure the old `sip.conf` (*"chan_sip"*), in which case you will have to convert the `sip.conf` configuration to `pjsip.conf`.

## How to use this project

### 1. Prepare your VoipMS account

If you're like me, you'll probably find this Git repo 5 years from when I am writing this, and everything will look different by then. Still, I'll show how to prepare your VoipMS account to support this project, and explain what the various settings do. This might help you adapt to what it looks like now, or show how to do this for another VoIP provider.

This will _look_ quite long because of all the screenshots and because I explain what the options do, but it's really no big deal :) .

#### Create VoipMS account and get a number

First, you should 1) create a VoipMS account, 2) get a DID number ("phone number") (or port your existing phone number to VoipMS, but I'd suggest testing this project out first) and 3) put some money on your account.

#### Account settings

Once that's done, go to _Account Settings_.

![Where to find Account Settings](my-data/README_img/AccountSettings.png "Where to find Account Settings")

Under the _Account Routing_ tab, you have the option of carrying voice data using the "Value" (less costly) option or the "Premium" (more reliable) option. Choose which ever one you like ; I chose "Value" because I have never had problems with it. **Don't forget to click "Apply All"!**

![Account Settings > Account Routing page](my-data/README_img/AccountSettings-AccountRouting.png "Account Settings > Account Routing page")

Now, under the _General_ tab, select _I use a system capable of passing its own CallerID_. This settings means that the CallerID (the name that phones you call will display) will be provided by our Asterisk server, rather than setting it on VoipMS's web interface. **Don't forget to click "Apply All"!**

![Account Settings > General page](my-data/README_img/AccountSettings-General.png "Account Settings > General page")

Under the _Inbound Settings_ tab, specify you wish to use the _SIP_ protocol, and that your SIP device is "_IP PBX Server, Asterisk or Softswitch_". These settings tell VoipMS that we are a server and not a phone/softphone, and that we want VoipMS to establish calls with our device using the SIP protocol. **Don't forget to click "Apply All"!**

![Account Settings > Inbound Settings page](my-data/README_img/AccountSettings-InboundSettings.png "Account Settings > Inbound Settings page")

Under the _Advanced tab_, make sure _NAT_ is set to _yes_, since I assume your server will be behind a NAT. Setting to _yes_ does not hurt even if your server is not behind a NAT anyway. This setting should resolve problems where you are able to call a "real" phone number using VoipMS or receive calls from "real" phone numbers from VoipMS but our Asterisk server can't receive the audio from VoipMS, VoipMS can't receive audio from our Asterisk server, or both. (Note that this _doesn't_ fix audio transmission problems between _your phone_ and the Asterisk server ; the port forwarding (explained later) and some of the configuration in `pjsip.conf` fix that.)

Still under the _Advanced tab_, also activate some of the codecs. If you're unsure which codecs to choose, only check _G.711U_ (which is the µ-law/ulaw/mulaw codec). The audio codecs are essentially the formats to use to send/receive the audio. In case you are interested, I found [this video tutorial on codecs useful when making this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7feTItIs0s&list=PLnzEbgyK52Gu9fdVDHburrsG3KBIntXFK&index=37). **Don't forget to click "Apply All"!**

#### SIP URI creation

VoipMS requires us to "create" a URL that points to our server.  Once we'll configure our DID number, we'll have the option of selecting that URL as where to send calls to our Asterisk server. I guess another VoIP provider might allow you to specify the SIP URI when configuring the DID number ("phone number") rather than having to create it ahead of time.

To do this, go to SIP URIs as shown below.

![Where to find SIP URIs](my-data/README_img/SipUris.png "Where to find SIP URIs")

Once there, click the _"Add SIP URI"_ button. Specify `voipms@<domain_name>:<port>`, where `<domain_name>` is your Asterisk server's domain name or IP address, and `<port>` is the UDP port number of Asterisk's SIP server. If you have no reason not to, use `5060` for `<port>` (or even don't specify `:<port>` at all, which is equivalent of adding `:5060`).

Note that, as the screenshot below shows, I personally have two SIP URIs. You only really need one, though.

![SIP URIs > Adding a SIP URI](my-data/README_img/SipUris-Add.png "SIP URIs > Adding a SIP URI")

#### DID configuration

Finally, we must configure the DID number ("phone number") we got from VoipMS. Go to _Manage DID(s)_.

![Where to find Manage DID(s)](my-data/README_img/ManageDids.png "Where to find Manage DID(s)")

Edit the DID number you got from VoipMS. Note that, as the screenshot below shows, I personally have two DID numbers since I got one from VoipMS and later ported my "real" phone number over to VoipMS, but you only need one number.

![Manage DID(s) > Edit DID](my-data/README_img/ManageDids-EditDid.png "Manage DID(s) > Edit DID")

Once there, under _Routing_, choose _SIP URI_ and select the SIP URI you created earlier. This tells VoipMS to send incoming calls (and SMS messages) to that server.

![Manage DID(s) > Edit DID > Choose SIP URI](my-data/README_img/ManageDids-EditDid-1.png "Manage DID(s) > Edit DID")

Next, under _DID Point of Presence_, choose whichever region and server that is close to your location. This is the VoipMS server that will send calls to our Asterisk server. Note that the configuration file (explained later) will need the URL of that server, so, if you chose `montreal.voip.ms`, you will need to specify that later in the configuration file.

Below this, also make sure that _"Ring time in seconds"_ is set to a fairly high value (I chose 60sec). This is the maximum amount of time the VoipMS server will leave callers ringing until hanging up. If this value is small, our phones will ring but our Asterisk server won't have the time to go to voicemail because the VoipMS server will hangup the call before we could go to voicemail.

![Manage DID(s) > Edit DID > Choose DID POP and ring time](my-data/README_img/ManageDids-EditDid-2.png "Manage DID(s) > Edit DID > Choose DID POP and ring time")

Finally, to enable SMS messages, check the _"Enable SMS/MMS"_ box. Note that, at the time of writing this, SMS messages with VoipMS are free because it's apparently a new/experimental feature of VoipMS.

Also choose your main account as _SMS SIP Account_. The _"SMS/MMS email address"_ is not necessary ; it only means you get an email at this address every time you receive an SMS message.

**Don't forget to click the button to apply changes!**

### 2. Prepare your network

This project configures Asterisk to use SIP (for registering, starting calls, etc.) and RTP (for the actual voice data). If you want to actually place/receive calls from VoipMS, or even if you want to be able to use a phone/softphone outside of home, you will need to forward some NAT ports on your router:

- One UDP port for SIP signalling ; use UDP port 5060 if you have no reason not to.
- About 100 UDP ports for RTP ; e.g. UDP 18000-18099.

If you don't know how do the port forwarding, search something like _NAT port forwarding_ on the internet. Most home routers have a web interface that you can access from your browser by typing the routers IP address (e.g. `192.168.0.1` on some routers). You can do the port forwarding there. If you don't know the router's username/password, there usually is a reset button on the router to reset it back to factory settings and factory username/password.

Notes:

- Take note of which ports you forwarded ; you will need to specify them in the configuration file (explained below).
- If you are running the Asterisk server in a VM, you need to also make sure the ports are forwarded from the host to the VM. I haven't done it, but you will need to either 1) make sure the VM is either NATted or bridged to the host *and* that you forward these ports to the VM, or 2) enable a physical connection from the VM to the network (which I think requires trifling with BIOS and kernel boot arguments). The idea is similar if you run this project inside a container you made.
- If your NAT is a full-cone NAT, you probably won't need to forward the RTP ports because I configured a STUN server in the Asterisk config files. If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry about it anyway.
- Obviously, if you put the Asterisk server in your DMZ, there is no need to forward anything. But if you know what I'm talking about, then you probably don't need *me* to tell you this!

### 3. Create config file

Create a copy the file `sample/config-file-template.txt` and fill in the missing variable values. Run `./update.sh --help` for an explanation of each variable.

Note that, like many other projects, it's possible that `sample/config-file-template.txt` is no longer up-to-date at the time you read this. Run `./update.sh --help` for an up-to-date list of variables to set.

### 4. Actually install and setup everything

To **erase** the current Asterisk configuration and use this repo's configuration, run as root:

```bash
./update.sh install --conf /your/config/file
```

...where `/your/config/file` is the config file you created in the preceding step.

Notes:

- You will need the `ffmpeg` program in your `PATH` if you specify in the config file formats other than WAV (e.g. `VOICEMAIL_FORMAT=wav|ulaw`). On Ubuntu 18.04, I installed `ffmpeg` with the command `sudo apt install ffmpeg`.
- Even though the `update.sh` script gives the impression that it can create a Docker container to run this project in, it's been a while that I tested it, so I'm not sure if it works.
- The time range that Asterisk uses to go straight to voicemail past a certain time is the system's time, so make sure you have the correct timezone configured on your system. Run the `date` command to tell if that is the case. To change your server's timezone, use the server's GUI if you have a GUI installed, or run a command to do so. Under Ubuntu 18.04, I used `dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` to change my server's timezone.
